/// <summary>
/// For checking/testing if a proposed new connection on a NEAT genome would form a connectivity cycle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class utilises a depth first graph traversal algorithm to check if a proposed new connection on a given
/// graph would form a cycle, as such it is assumed that the graph as given is acyclic, if it isn't then the graph
/// traversal stack will grown to infinity, ultimately resulting in an OutOfMemory exception.
///
/// The algorithm will perform a full depth first traversal of the graph starting at the proposed new connection's
/// target node, and if that connection's source node is encountered then it would form a cycle if it were added
/// to the graph.
///
/// Each instance of this class allocates a stack and a hashset for use by the traversal algorithm, and these
/// are cleared and re-used for each call to IsConnectionCyclic(). This avoids memory re-allocation and garbage
/// collection overhead, but the side effect is that IsConnectionCyclic() is not reentrant, i.e. can only be in
/// use by one execution thread at a given point in time. A reentrancy check will throw an exception if reentrancy
/// is attempted.
///
///
/// Implementation Details / Notes
/// ----------------------
/// This class is optimized for speed and efficiency and as such is tightly coupled with the connection gene list
/// data structure, and is perhaps not as easy to read/understand as a traditional depth first graph traversal
/// algorithm using function recursion. However this is essentially a depth first graph traversal algorithm that
/// utilises its own stack instead of using the call stack.
///
/// The traversal stack is a stack of Int32(s), each of which is an index into connList (the list of connections
/// that make up the graph, ordered by sourceId and then targetId). Thus, each stack entry points to a connection,
/// and represents traversal of that connection's source node and also which of that node's child connections/nodes
/// is the current traversal position/path from that node (note. this works because the connections are sorted by
/// sourceId first).
///
/// As such this algorithm has a far more compact stack frame than the equivalent algorithm implemented as a
/// recursive function, and avoids any other method call overhead as a further performance benefit (i.e. overhead
/// other than stack frame initialisation).
///
/// The main optimizations then are:
///
///    * No method call overhead from recursive method calls.
///
///    * Each stack frame is a single int32 and thus the stack as a whole is highly compact; this improves CPU cache
///      locality and hit rate, and also keeps the max size of the stack for any given traversal at a minimum.
///
///    * The stack and a visitedNodes HashSet are allocated for each class instance and are cleared and re-used for each
///      call to IsConnectionCyclic(), therefore minimizing memory allocation and garbage collection overhead.
///
///    * Using a stack on the heap also avoids any potential for a stack overflow on very deep graphs, which could occur
///      if using method call recursion.
///
/// Problems with the approach of this class are:
///
///    * The code is more complex than the same algorithm written as a recursive function; this makes the code harder
///      to read, understand and maintain, thus increasing the probability of subtle defects.
///

/// <see cref="Graphs.Acyclic.CyclicConnectionCheck"/>
/// <see cref="Graphs.Acyclic.AcyclicGraphDepthAnalysis"/>
/// <see cref="CyclicGraphCheck"/>.
