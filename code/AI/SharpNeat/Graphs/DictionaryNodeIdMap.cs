/// An INodeIdMap implementation based on a dictionary keyed by node ID and a fixed node count.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The fixed nodes count defines the identity mapping (i.e. x maps to x) for IDs from 0 to count-1,
/// i.e. it's a cheap way of describing those mappings rather than including them in the dictionary,
/// which is relatively expensive to populate and query.
///
/// Input nodes are *always* fixed, i.e. they exist in a contiguous run of IDs starting at zero.
/// In cyclic networks the output nodes are also fixed, starting directly after the input node IDs.
/// In acyclic networks the outputs are not fixed, and are therefore mapped by the dictionary.
